							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> White space is super important in design. It helps organize things by showing what's most important, grouping stuff together, 
								and making different parts of a page clear. Plus, it makes things easier to read and keeps everything looking nice and balanced. 
								It also helps draw attention to important stuff and keeps everything lined up and looking the same. 
								Think of it like a conductor in a silent orchestra, making sure everything on the page looks good and is easy for people to use. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the analogy it uses to explain the importance of white space in design. 
								Comparing white space to a breath of fresh air, just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe, 
								is a simple yet powerful way to convey the significance of this design element. 
								It makes the concept of white space more relatable and easier to understand, even for those who may not be familiar with design principles. 
								This analogy emphasizes that white space isn't just a design choice but a fundamental element that contributes to the user experience. </p>
