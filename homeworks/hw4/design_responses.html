						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is accessibility in digital product design is crucial for ensuring that all individuals, 
								including those with disabilities, can interact with and use digital products effectively. 
								It's both an ethical best practice and often a legal requirement. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is its mention of the legal implications of 
								not complying with accessibility standards. It highlights that there have been numerous federal lawsuits filed about allegedly 
								inaccessible websites, including class actions. This serves as a reminder that in addition to ethical considerations, there can be 
								legal consequences for organizations that do not make their digital products accessible.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "To meet W3Câ€™s minimum AA rating, your background-to-text contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1. 
								So, when designing things like buttons, cards, or navigation elements,
								 be sure to check the contrast ratio of your color combinations." </p>
