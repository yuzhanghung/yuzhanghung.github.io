						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that easing is a crucial concept in animation, making object movements appear natural. It involves using acceleration and deceleration to create realistic motion, and different types of easing curves (ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out) are used depending on the context and purpose of the animation. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One of the standout sections is the explanation of easing, which helps readers understand how to make animations appear more natural and engaging. The discussion on choreography in interface animation provides valuable insights into guiding user attention effectively during transitions.  </p>
