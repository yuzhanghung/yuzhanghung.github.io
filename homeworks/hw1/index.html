         Hi my name is Yuli! I am from San Francisco and I live in Stern Hall.
            I like to listen to music and watch Youtube in my free time. 
            I am excited to come to UCB and ready to learn new codings!

             Part 2: Reading Responses

         <ul>
             <li>Something I learned from the article is to become better at design, we should closely look at and think like a designer when using apps. 
                 Pay attention to how things are organized, what content is used, and who the app is for. 
                 By doing this, we can learn from existing designs and become better designers ourselves. 
             </li>
             <li>
                The cool part of the article is when it talks about looking closely at apps and thinking
                about why they look the way they do. 
                This helps us get better at design by understanding how things like layout and content are chosen.
                It's not just about apps; it can make us better at designing lots of things.

                thinking and get better at designing apps yourself.""
