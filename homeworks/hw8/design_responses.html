						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> From this article, I learn about the concept of "Dark Patterns" in UX/UI design—deceptive strategies aimed at influencing user behavior for business gain. The history and evolution of Dark Patterns are discussed, highlighting their prevalence in the digital landscape. The article emphasizes the ethical implications of using such practices, calling for responsible and transparent design to prioritize user well-being over short-term business objectives. Additionally, it explores the potential broader societal impact of Dark Patterns and suggests the need for ethical guidelines in design practices.

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> This article talks about sneaky tricks on websites and apps called "Dark Patterns." They make people do things they might not want to do, like hiding extra costs when you shop online or making it tricky to stop subscriptions. The article also says these tricks were even used in spreading fake news during the US Elections. It suggests that designers should be more honest and think about the impact of what they create.
